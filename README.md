# Greenhouse Database

This repository contains the final project for my Databases class, which is a greenhouse database designed for both customers and employees. The project is built using a MySQL database and is intended to store information about different types of plants, including their unique water and sun needs.

## Project Description

The project's goal is to create a user-friendly greenhouse database that customers and employees can interact with. The greenhouse has several sections dedicated to different types of plants, and the database will store data related to each plant, such as its unique water and sun needs.

Customers can query the database for information about the plants they are interested in, or for specific employees who may specialize in the plants they are looking for. They can also query the database to locate a specific plant within the greenhouse. Additionally, if a customer decides to purchase a plant, the database will adjust the inventory accordingly.

The database also allows customers to keep track of their plants' hydration status, and they can update the database by inputting data on when they last watered the plant.
